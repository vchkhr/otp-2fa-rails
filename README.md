# OTP 2FA Rails

This is a demo application with One-time password Two-factor authentication in Ruby on Rails with Devise gem.

## Branches

* `with-otp-2fa` (main branch) -- application with auth and OTP 2FA.
* `plain-app` -- application with auth, but without 2FA.

## Requirements

Please ensure you are using Docker Compose V2. This project relies on the `docker compose` command, not the previous `docker-compose` standalone program.

https://docs.docker.com/compose/#compose-v2-and-the-new-docker-compose-command

Check your docker compose version with:
```
% docker compose version
Docker Compose version v2.10.2
```

## Initial setup
```
cp .env.example .env
docker compose build
docker compose run --rm web bin/rails db:setup
```

## Running the Rails app
```
docker compose up
```

## Running the Rails console
When the app is already running with `docker-compose` up, attach to the container:
```
docker compose exec web bin/rails c
```

When no container running yet, start up a new one:
```
docker compose run --rm web bin/rails c
```

## Running tests
```
docker compose run --rm web bin/rspec
```

## Updating gems
```
docker compose run --rm web bundle update
docker compose up --build
```

## Production build

```
docker build -f production.Dockerfile .
```
